## Overview

This repository contains ABAP code samples and examples that demonstrate various functionalities and features in SAP ABAP programming. The repository includes different projects, libraries, and reusable components for developers to easily understand and implement ABAP solutions.

## Features

- **Sample Programs**: Examples for different SAP modules, such as FI, MM, SD, and more.
- **Best Practices**: Coding standards and practices for efficient ABAP development.
- **Utilities**: Reusable function modules and classes.
- **Enhancements**: How to enhance SAP standard programs using ABAP.

## Prerequisites

- SAP ECC or S/4HANA system (version specific depending on your use case).
- Basic knowledge of ABAP programming language.
- SAP Netweaver AS ABAP environment for testing and deployment.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waruna-lakshantha/ABAP-KT
```

### 2. Upload Code to SAP System

After cloning the repository, follow these steps to upload the ABAP code to your SAP system:

1. Open the SAP GUI and log in to your SAP system.
2. Use the transaction **SE80** (Object Navigator).
3. Upload the ABAP objects (programs, function modules, classes, etc.) by navigating to the relevant object and importing it.
4. Activate the code after uploading.

## Usage

### Example Program

Here is an example of how to use one of the code samples:

```abap
DATA: lv_example TYPE string.

lv_example = 'Hello, ABAP!'.
WRITE: / lv_example.
```

This simple program displays a message in the SAP GUI.

### Function Module Example

You can also use our reusable function module `ZFM_EXAMPLE` as follows:

```abap
DATA: lv_result TYPE string.

CALL FUNCTION 'ZFM_EXAMPLE'
  EXPORTING
    iv_input = 'ABAP Example'
  IMPORTING
    ev_result = lv_result.

WRITE: / lv_result.
```

This function module processes the input and returns a result.
